# Train  POS

- as a host I should be able to go go to a table and tally orders with modifications
- as a first cook, i should be able to recieve the same info as a host
- the first cook should also recieve a consolidated list of all orders, therefore not cooking extra protiens and having an accurate count. 
- when a host  sends an order, a bill should be sent to the kitchen or appear on a QSR screen
- when a bill is completed, the first cook should be able to mark the item as complete and the host will sell the bill until service is complete.

- when the service is complete, the consolidated bill should be emailed to the sous chef(me)
